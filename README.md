# ML Classification

Have you ever wondered how spam emails are detected, why some loan requests get rejected, or how Google Images can accurately recognize objects?
All of these are real-world applications of classification in Machine Learning.

In this section, we’ll explore what classification means, how to build a simple classification model, and the key metrics used to evaluate its performance.


In simple terms, classification is a type of supervised machine learning. Supervised means the model is trained with guidance — using input features along with their corresponding output labels. If the output variable is continuous, the task is called regression; if the output is categorical, it is called classification.

Binary Classification – When the output has only two categories, such as whether to approve a loan or not, or whether an email is spam or not.

Multi-class Classification – When the output has more than two discrete categories, such as classifying different types of skin diseases
